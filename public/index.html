Run for shelter

There is a bank

<p>
You need to get into bank
</p>
Once in bank you need to find a place to hide
<p>
You need to find a place lined in lead so that the Krytosaurs cannot see you
</br>
Only one place in bank is lead lined
</br>
THE HIDDEN VAULT!!!!

You need to navigate through the bank which is an old 1800s - 1900s design

You have 3.33 minutes to find the vault before you are turned into a Krytonian Kebab
